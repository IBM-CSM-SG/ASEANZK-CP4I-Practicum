## Multi-Style Integration with IBM Cloud Pak for Integration the Kafka Experience
Get hands on building API and Event driven flows. Create no-code integrations using IBM App Connect and expose and manage the APIs created with IBM API Connect. 

This scenario can be implemented/developed using one of the below two ways. You can use online CP4I App Connect Designer to design the flow and export is as bar file to be deployed it on the integration server. Alternatively you can use traditional App Connect Enterprise (ACE) to design the flow and export the bar file to be deployed on the integratin server.

You can refer to below instructions to **[Create Connection to shared Kafka cluster.](Kafka-Pre-lab/Kafka-Pre-Lab.md)** Steps to create Kafka connection and save credentials and certs for all Kafka labs.
